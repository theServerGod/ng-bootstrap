ng-bootstrap
============
AngularJS and Bootstrap project seed

Getting Started
---------------
Install `bower` dependencies:

	bower install

By default, this project uses the [Bootstrap Theme](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/) template from Bootstrap.

If you want a minimal setup, without Gulp or Grunt, you can just use the npm package `http-server` to serve the files. From the project root directory, run the command:

	http-server ./

By default, `http-server` will serve `./public` (if it exists) on port 8080 unless you tell it otherwise, in this case `./`.

Now you can access your local instance with:

	http://localhost:8080
